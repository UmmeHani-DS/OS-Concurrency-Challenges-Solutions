# Concurrency Challenges Solutions

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to two concurrency challenges implemented in C/C++. These challenges address common problems encountered in multi-threaded programming, providing practical solutions to ensure efficient, fault-tolerant, and scalable concurrent execution.

## Objective

The objective of this repository is to provide practical implementations for handling concurrency challenges in real-world scenarios. By addressing specific problems such as mutual exclusion and traffic management, the solutions aim to demonstrate effective concurrency handling techniques using C/C++ programming languages.

## Methodologies

The solutions leverage well-established algorithms and techniques to address concurrency challenges:
- **Bakery Algorithm Lock Implementation**: The Bakery algorithm is used to implement a lock and unlock mechanism, ensuring mutual exclusion in multi-threaded programs.
- **Traffic Management System**: A mutex synchronization mechanism is implemented to manage traffic flow on a historic bridge with limited capacity, ensuring controlled access for different types of vehicles.

## Technologies Used

The solutions are implemented using the following technologies:
- **C/C++**: The primary programming languages used for implementing the solutions.
- **pthread Library**: The pthread library is utilized for multi-threading support in C++ programs.

## Conclusion

The solutions provided in this repository offer practical implementations for handling concurrency challenges in real-world scenarios. By leveraging well-established algorithms and techniques, these solutions ensure efficient and fault-tolerant concurrent execution. Whether it's ensuring mutual exclusion or managing traffic flow, the implementations demonstrate effective concurrency handling techniques using C/C++ programming languages.
